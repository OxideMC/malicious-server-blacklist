# Malicious Server Blacklist

A list of Minecraft servers that
- are against Minecraft EULA
- are against Minecraft Commercial Usage Guidelines (aka pay-to-win)
- are malicious (eg. IP loggers)
- distribute harmful content
- distribute "cracked" versions of the game¹

> ¹ If a server allows "cracked" players but doesn't distribute "cracked" versions of the game, it won't enter this list.

## But Mojang already does this?

Their list is ineffective as they first politely ask the server owners to stop and don't take immediate action.
